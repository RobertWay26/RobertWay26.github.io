        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Robert, but feel free to call me Rob.
            I'm currently in my sophomore year at Texas A&M University,
            with credits placing me technically as a junior.
            Though my formal education in computing spans just over a year,
            I've been passionately developing programs both in and out of the classroom for six years.
            When I'm not programming, you'll find me running, playing soccer (also known as football), or skateboarding.
